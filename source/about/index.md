## Study Bio
  In 2014, I was admitted to Hohai university. I major in information management and information system, but i put lots of my free time to study computer science and math. I study programming method which is opencourse from stanford. I also learn C, Python, Scheme, and a little about how to build Dynamic Websites which are taught by David J. Malan who is an instructor from Harvard extension school. What is more, I am interested in analysing algorithms and  designing algorithms. Recently, i worked on low-level programming, which involves a lot about memory management, concurrent programming, generic program and data structure using pure C, which I think are fun and also beautiful. I think I have great programming style and enjoy using computer to solve difficult problem.


Outside of study, I enjoy spending time with family, going on outdoor excursions, and etc.
