I have learned the dynamic programing and realized 0-1 knapsack problem using python. Dynamic programing is useful and also simple. I will note some details about dynamic programing.


The dynamic programing has two features:
1. Over lapping sub-problems
2. Optimal substructure

the core of dynamic programing is memoization, which means that we use table lookup. We save results which we have calculated.  And global optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions to still available sub-problems. When i solve knapsack problems, i use decesion tree to make myself understand the process of dynamic programing how to work. I also use back track. 

Conclusion:
1.we use space to exchange time
2.Don't be intimidates by exp. problem.
3.It's very broadlly useful.
4.We should learn problem reduction.
